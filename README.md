ðŸš— Optimizing Highway Traffic with the Highway Management System! ðŸ›£

Excited to share my latest project in algorithm-driven systems â€” the Highway Management System! This system focuses on improving traffic flow, monitoring highway activity, and ensuring safety by managing multiple key functions, including:

ðŸ”¹ Home Entrance

ðŸ”¹ Drivers

ðŸ”¹ Service Area

ðŸ”¹ Accident

ðŸ”¹ Exit

ðŸ“Š The system tracks real-time data such as:

âœ…Number of Entry Vehicles

âœ…Vehicles Currently on the Highway

âœ…Number of Accidents

âœ…Fuel Consumption (Petrol/Diesel)

âœ…Number of Drivers

By leveraging algorithms, the Highway Management System ensures efficient traffic control, safer driving conditions, and optimized fuel usage, creating a smoother experience for drivers.
